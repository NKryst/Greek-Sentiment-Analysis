# Greek-Sentiment-Analysis

Hello there after a long time which I dedicated for writting my dissertation I came up with the following scripts in order to do these simple things:

 - Extract Sentiment of Tweets written to Greek Language
 - Perform Network Analysis at words
 - Get the most frequent words
 - Get the geographic locations of Tweets
 
 I believe this is useful
 
 In order to achieve Sentiment Analysis in Greek Language I used the Greek Sentiment Lexicon which you can also find in this repository

 A huge thanks!
